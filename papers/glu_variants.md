## Overview

This paper explores variants of Gated Linear Units (GLU) as alternatives to traditional activation functions in Transformer feed-forward networks. The research demonstrates that several GLU variants, particularly SwiGLU and GEGLU, outperform standard activations like ReLU and GELU, leading to their adoption in major language models like PaLM and LLaMA.

## Key Problem Addressed

Traditional Transformer feed-forward networks use simple activation functions that may not be optimal:

1. **ReLU Limitations**: Simple but can cause gradient issues and limited expressiveness
2. **GELU Performance**: Better than ReLU but still room for improvement
3. **Activation Function Choice**: Limited exploration of gating mechanisms in FFNs
4. **Model Quality**: Need for better activation functions to improve model performance

## Background: Gated Linear Units (GLU)

The original GLU (Dauphin et al., 2016) consists of:
```
GLU(x) = (xW + b) ⊙ σ(xV + c)
```

Where:
- `x` is the input
- `W` and `V` are weight matrices
- `b` and `c` are bias vectors
- `σ` is the sigmoid function
- `⊙` denotes element-wise multiplication

## GLU Variants Explored

The paper explores different activation functions in place of sigmoid:

### 1. Original GLU
```
GLU(x) = (xW + b) ⊙ σ(xV + c)
```
Uses sigmoid gating function.

### 2. ReGLU
```
ReGLU(x) = (xW + b) ⊙ ReLU(xV + c)
```
Replaces sigmoid with ReLU.

### 3. GEGLU
```
GEGLU(x) = (xW + b) ⊙ GELU(xV + c)
```
Uses GELU as the gating function.

### 4. SwiGLU
```
SwiGLU(x) = (xW + b) ⊙ Swish(xV + c)
```
Where Swish(x) = x · σ(x).

### 5. Bilinear
```
Bilinear(x) = (xW + b) ⊙ (xV + c)
```
No nonlinear gating (linear gating).

## Integration into Transformer FFN

### Standard FFN
```
FFN(x) = ReLU(xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂
```

### GLU-based FFN
```
FFN_GLU(x) = GLU_variant(x)W₂ + b₂
```

Where GLU_variant produces the gated representation.

## Why GLU Variants Work

### 1. Gating Mechanism
