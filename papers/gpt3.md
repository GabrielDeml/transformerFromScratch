## Overview

GPT-3 represents a paradigm shift in natural language processing, demonstrating that sufficiently large language models can perform a wide variety of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. With 175 billion parameters, GPT-3 showed that scaling up model size leads to emergent capabilities, including few-shot learning, reasoning, and human-like text generation.

## Key Problem Addressed

Prior to GPT-3, most NLP systems required:

1. **Task-Specific Fine-tuning**: Models needed to be fine-tuned on each specific task
2. **Supervised Learning**: Required large amounts of labeled data for each task
3. **Narrow Specialization**: Models were typically good at one task but poor at others
4. **Human-like Adaptability Gap**: Humans can learn new tasks with just a few examples, but AI systems couldn't

## Core Innovation: In-Context Learning

GPT-3's breakthrough was demonstrating that large language models can learn tasks **in-context** without parameter updates:

### Few-Shot Learning Paradigm
- **Zero-shot**: Task description only, no examples
- **One-shot**: Task description + one example
- **Few-shot**: Task description + few examples (typically 10-100)

### How It Works
Instead of fine-tuning, GPT-3 uses the input context to understand the task:

```
Translate English to French:
English: Hello
French: Bonjour
English: How are you?
French: Comment allez-vous?
English: I am fine
French: [GPT-3 generates "Je vais bien"]
```

## Model Architecture and Scale

### Architecture Details
- **Based on Transformer decoder architecture** (like GPT-1/2)
- **Autoregressive**: Predicts next token given previous tokens
