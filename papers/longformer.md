## Overview

Longformer addresses the fundamental limitation of Transformer models in processing long sequences by introducing a sparse attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length. Unlike standard self-attention's quadratic complexity, Longformer can efficiently process documents with thousands of tokens, making it practical for long-document understanding tasks.

## Key Problem Addressed

Standard Transformer models face critical limitations with long sequences:

1. **Quadratic Complexity**: Self-attention scales as O(n²) with sequence length
2. **Memory Constraints**: Cannot process documents longer than 512-4096 tokens
3. **Computational Inefficiency**: Prohibitive costs for long document processing
4. **Limited Context**: Important information may be lost due to truncation

## Core Innovation: Sliding Window Attention

Longformer introduces a **sliding window attention** mechanism that combines local and global attention patterns:

### 1. Sliding Window Attention
- Each token attends to `w/2` tokens on each side (total window size `w`)
- Typically w = 512 for most tasks
- Provides local context while maintaining linear complexity
- Enables information flow through multiple attention layers

### 2. Global Attention
- Specific tokens attend to all positions in the sequence
- All tokens can attend to these global tokens
- Task-specific: different tokens can be designated as global
- Examples: [CLS] token for classification, question tokens for QA

### 3. Dilated Sliding Window
- Some layers use dilated windows (gaps between attended positions)
- Increases receptive field without additional computation
- Similar to dilated convolutions

## Attention Complexity Analysis

### Standard Attention
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n²)
- **Scalability**: Prohibitive for long sequences

### Longformer Attention
- **Time Complexity**: O(n × w) where w is window size
- **Space Complexity**: O(n × w)
- **Scalability**: Linear with sequence length

### Memory Efficiency
- For n = 4096, w = 512: 8x memory reduction
- Enables processing of much longer documents
- Maintains computational efficiency

## Architecture Details

### Attention Patterns
1. **Local Windowed**: Each token attends to w neighboring tokens
2. **Global**: Selected tokens attend to entire sequence
3. **Dilated**: Some layers use gaps in attention windows

### Implementation
- Drop-in replacement for standard self-attention
- Compatible with existing Transformer architectures
- Supports both encoder-only and encoder-decoder variants

### Position Encoding
- Uses learned positional embeddings
- Supports sequences up to maximum trained length
- Can be extended for longer sequences

if token_is_global:
    attention_scores = compute_full_attention(query, key, value)
```

### 2. Global Token Selection
- Choosing which tokens should be global is task-dependent
- Affects model performance significantly
- Requires domain expertise

### 3. Position Encoding
