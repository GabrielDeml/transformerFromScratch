## Overview

Mixed Precision Training introduces a methodology to train deep neural networks using half-precision (16-bit) floating point numbers while maintaining model accuracy. As model sizes grow beyond 100 million parameters, this approach addresses the increasing memory and compute requirements by reducing memory usage by nearly 2x while preserving training stability through careful handling of numerical precision.

## Key Problem Addressed

Deep neural network training faces escalating resource demands:

1. **Memory Growth**: Model sizes require increasingly large memory
2. **Compute Requirements**: Training time grows with model complexity
3. **Hardware Limitations**: Single-precision training hits memory walls
4. **Scaling Challenges**: Difficulty training very large models

## Core Innovation: Half-Precision Training

### IEEE Half-Precision Format (FP16)
- **16-bit representation**: 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, 10 mantissa bits
- **Reduced memory**: ~50% memory reduction compared to FP32
- **Limited range**: Â±65,504 (much smaller than FP32's ~10^38)
- **Reduced precision**: 3-4 decimal digits vs. 7 for FP32

### Challenges with Half-Precision
- **Gradient Underflow**: Small gradients become zero
- **Limited Dynamic Range**: Cannot represent very large or small numbers
- **Precision Loss**: Reduced numerical precision affects convergence

## Three Key Techniques

### 1. Master Weights Copy
```python
# Maintain FP32 master copy of weights
master_weights = model.parameters()  # FP32

# Forward pass with FP16 weights
fp16_weights = master_weights.half()
output = model(input, fp16_weights)

# Backward pass produces FP16 gradients
loss.backward()

# Update master weights in FP32
optimizer.step(master_weights)
```

**Benefits:**
- Accumulates gradients in full precision
- Preserves small weight updates
- Maintains training stability

### 2. Loss Scaling
```python
# Scale loss to prevent gradient underflow
scaled_loss = loss * scale_factor

# Backward pass with scaled loss
scaled_loss.backward()

# Unscale gradients before optimizer step
for param in model.parameters():
    param.grad = param.grad / scale_factor

optimizer.step()
```

**Key Aspects:**
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adjust scale factor
- **Gradient Preservation**: Prevents small gradients from becoming zero
- **Overflow Detection**: Monitor for gradient overflow and adjust scaling

### 3. Half-Precision Arithmetic
- **FP16 Storage**: Store activations and gradients in FP16
- **FP32 Computation**: Perform accumulation in FP32
- **Memory Efficiency**: Convert to FP16 for storage
- **Numerical Stability**: Maintain precision where needed

## Implementation Details

### Dynamic Loss Scaling
```python
class DynamicLossScaler:
    def __init__(self, init_scale=2**15, growth_factor=2.0):
        self.scale = init_scale
        self.growth_factor = growth_factor
        self.backoff_factor = 0.5
        self.growth_interval = 2000
    
    def update_scale(self, has_overflow):
        if has_overflow:
            self.scale *= self.backoff_factor
        else:
            self.scale *= self.growth_factor
```

### Gradient Clipping
```python
# Clip gradients to prevent overflow
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
```

### Mixed Precision Forward Pass
```python
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
    output = model(input)
    loss = criterion(output, target)

# Scale loss and backward pass
scaler.scale(loss).backward()
scaler.step(optimizer)
scaler.update()
```
